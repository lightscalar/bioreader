# Bioreader

 `bioreader.py` is a script for configuring the Biomonitor SD cards as well as
 extracting stored data.

## Requirements

The `bioreader.py` script was written and tested in Python 3.7.1, though it
should be compatible with Python 3.6+. The script relies on a number of third
party libraries.  To ensure these are available, run,

```unix
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Resetting an SD card

Before use in a Biomontor device, the SD card must be configured. This can be
done using the following command:

```unix
python bioreader.py /path/to/sd/card --reset
```

or,

```unix
python bioreader.py /path/to/sd/card -r
```

Please note that this will *erase all data on the SD card*, and is not
reversible. You will be asked to confirm that you **really** want to do this to
avoid accidental data loss.

By default, the Biomonitor will record four channels of data — PZT Ring (0),
PPG (1), Bioimpedance (2), and ECG (3). In many cases, researchers will want to
collect only a subset of the channels. To do this, simply specify the channels
using the `--channels` flag during a card reset:

```unix
python bioreader.py /path/to/sd/card --reset --channels 0 1
```

In this example, the SD card will be configured so that only the PZT ring and
the PPG channel will be recorded.

## Extracting data

After data has been collected, you'll want to access to it. This is
accomplished using the `--extract` command. For example,

```unix
python bioreader.py /path/to/sd/card --extract
```

This will convert data from the Biomonitor's `.dat` format into easily readable
CSV files. The `.dat` files will not be deleted from the card during this
process. Only a reset command will remove data from the SD card.

By default, the script will extract the data into CSV files stored on
the SD card in a root-level folder called `/ARXIV`. To specify an alternate
location, you may specify a file destination on your computer:

```unix
python bioreader.py /path/to/sd/card --extract --destination /path/to/csv/files
```

## Reading Annotations

You can process raw annotation data into a readable CSV file using the
`read_annotations.py` script. Simply call,

```unix
> python read_annotations path/to/annotation/file -d path/to/destination/csv
```

By default, the script will attempt to write the CSV file back to the
`/Volumes/ANNOTATIONS` USB stick. The annotations CSV file records the board
id, annotation text, timestamp, and datetime string.

## Help

To see all available options, ask for help:

```unix
$~/dev/bioreader> python bioreader.py -h
usage: bioreader.py [-h] [-m [MINUTES]] [-d DESTINATION]
                    [-c CHANNELS [CHANNELS ...]] [-r] [-e]
                    path [path ...]

Extract data from and configure Biomonitor SD cards.

positional arguments:
  path                  The location of the target SD card

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m [MINUTES], --minutes [MINUTES]
                        Maximum duration of recording session, in minutes
  -d DESTINATION, --destination DESTINATION
                        Where should we store the extracted CSV files?
  -c CHANNELS [CHANNELS ...], --channels CHANNELS [CHANNELS ...]
                        Specify the channels we should record (0—PVDF; 1-PPG;
                        2—BIOZ; 3—ECG).
  -r, --reset           Erase all data on the SD card and write a new
                        configuration file.
  -e, --extract         Extract data from the SD card and produce CSV files.
  ```
